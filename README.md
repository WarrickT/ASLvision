# ASLVision: ASL Learning Web Application! ðŸ™Œ

## Project Description
This is one of my first times creating an ML algorithm completely from scratch and utilizing it in a project!<br/>
ASLVision uses OpenCV and a Random Forest Classifer (self-made) to help and test users' ASL alphabet signing. 

Access the **deployed** version here! https://aslvision-frontend.onrender.com/

## Key Features
ðŸ”¤ Real-time ASL alphabet recognition using webcam
ðŸ§  Custom-trained Random Forest classifier
ðŸ§ª Test mode with scoring and timers
ðŸŽ¥ Frontend webcam integration (MediaPipe Hands)

## Tech Stack! ðŸ’»
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS <br/>
Backend: Python + FastAPI <br/>
Web Camera Operations: OpenCV, MediaPipe Hands <br/>
ML Training: Pandas, Numpy

### Next Steps! 
This is Phase One of this project! The next steps of the project include

- Exploring more ML algorithms that may outperform Random Forests
- Hosting Database for user's scores and preferences
- Adding ability to detecet words instead of just alphabets
